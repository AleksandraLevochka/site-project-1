            This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that formed there a quality of <a href="../mystery/index.html"><i>mystery</i></a> and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with each invisible detail -the placement of the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay; I need only <a href="../break_12/index.html"><i>pause</i></a> before it and I forget the passage of time.

<h1> A PRAISE OF SHADOWS</h1>
<h3>An Excerpt by Jun'ichiro Tanizaki</h3>

<p> I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand that in the Gothic cathedral <i><a href="../project-1-site/section_2/index.html">of the West</a></i>, the roof is <br> thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle as high in the heavens as possible-and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty.<br> In the temples of Japan, on the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, <i><a href="../project-1-site/section_2/index.html">shadows</a></i>  created by <br>the eaves the rest of the structure is built. Nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of the nobility and the houses of the <br>common people, what first strikes the eye is the massive roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves. <br>Even at midday cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making <i><a href="../project-1-site/section_2/index.html">entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible</a></i>. <br>The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings <br>of the past their <i> <a href="../project-1-site/section_2/index.html">roofs give the impression of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface</a></i> than all that stands beneath the eaves.

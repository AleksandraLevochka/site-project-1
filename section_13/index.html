        The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness, creating a world of confusion where dark and light are indistinguishable. Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that suffuses such a room, a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light? Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless, a fear that in that room <a href="../break_12/index.html"><i>you might lose all consciousness</i></a> of the passage of time, that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find you had grown old and gray?
